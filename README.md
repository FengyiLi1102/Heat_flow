## Project description
Cars utilise catalytic convertors to oxidise carbon monoxide in the exhaust gas into carbon dioxide. Current technology relies on alumina nanomaterials loaded with precious group metal nanoparticles. These are wash coated onto cordierite substrates that form the basis of the catalyst support. This technology suffers from a substantial drawback as the catalytic material only becomes active once it reaches approximately 150°C. In this problem, exhaust gas (300°C), containing 1at% carbon monoxide, enters the exhaust pipe (304 stainless steel, 10 cm length, 56mm outer diameter, 1mm wall thickness, initially at 25°C) at a rate of 50 L/s. The upstream face of the pipe is in perfect thermal contact with the exhaust manifold which maintains a constant temperature of 300°C. The gases pass along the exhaust and through a catalyst (cordierite substrate, 1cm length, initially at 25°C) at the exit of the pipe. The catalyst has elements, each 1 mm thick, arranged in a 10×10 square grid, with 4mm separation between elements. See the provided diagram (page 3) for clarification.

The pipe with the catalyst is shown in the following figure.
